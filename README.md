Main aim: Make a web application that would show informative soccer analytics

Ideas for Analytics

Theme 1: What shows that a league is competitive? 
How much money does the league pay its players
How many teams come in and out of the top 20 (relegation) 
How many teams win the UCL or Europa from that league (does the top 6 change usually)
How many goals (scored, conceded)?
How many points earned in the league? 

Analytics 1: Compare the difficulty (competitive) of various football leagues (variations of the changes in league table after every matchday).

Analytics 2: 

Historical data (from a particular year till 2023)
Get data from leagues (somehow) (API, MySQL
English Premier League
Spanish La Liga
French Ligue 1
Italian Serie A
German Bundesliga
Run analytics on the data (somehow) 
	
Display the results 
React


Other stuff: 
Update results after every match day 



TODO 1
Get a single data and establish an analytic then work on the rest
